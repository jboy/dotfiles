# Q: My xterm scrollbar does not work with screen.
# A: The problem is that xterm will not allow scrolling if the alternate
# text buffer is selected. The standard definitions of the termcap
# initialize capabilities ti and te switch to and from the alternate
# text buffer. (The scrollbar also does not work when you start e.g. ‘vi’).
# You can tell screen not to use these initialisations by adding the line
# “termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@” to your ~/.screenrc file.
#termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@
# Unfortunately, the scrollbar still doesn't work properly after this is
# enabled.  (I'm using Gnome Terminal.)  The terminal realises there is
# more text, so scales the size of the scrollbar accordingly; but the
# scrollbar position is not updated to jump to the end.
# Also PageUp/PageDown don't work properly -- they scroll the terminal
# screens, not the text in Screen -- so the first time you press PageUp,
# you jump up to the text before the Screen session.
