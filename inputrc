# (replacing "backward-char", which moves backward by a single character)
Control-b: character-search-backward

# (replacing "transpose-chars").

# Bind C-k to "kill-word", which kills from current position to end-of-word,
# since the default binding for "kill-word" is M-d, but AwesomeWM often uses
# Alt/Meta for its keyboard bindings, so I want to avoid clashed.
# (replacing "kill-line", which kills from current position to end-of-line)
